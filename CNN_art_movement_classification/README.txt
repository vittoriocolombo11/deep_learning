Please refer to the Final_Report.ipynb file, where you can find the codes and the steps to follow in order to go through our project. 

Our images are stored in the "Data" folder. We have 3 subfolders (train, validation and test) and 6 classes.
 
In the "images" folder you will see the images we used as style reference and target for the style transfer.

The "logs" folder contains the .csv files with the results of the CNN training. We used them to perform model selection and parameter tuning. 

In the "style transfer" folder you will see the results of the style transfer iterations and a .py file. You can run style_transfer.py in case the one on the Final_Report.ipynb does not work.

Finally "Web_scraping" contains all the steps implemented to build the dataset. Please refer to the README inside of the folder.
