# deep_learning
This is my group project for the Deep Learning for Computer Vision course at Universit√† Bocconi - DSBA.

We performed image classification of 6 different artistic movements using our own collected dataset. The model used is VGG16 of
Francois Chollet.

Also, we applied style transfer following the guidelines of Francois Chollet in the book "Deep Learning with Python".
